# Notes 

## Running locally 

- it looks like the order of the run commands matters. 
- to display other storybooks you have to load them before the mainb storybook, otherwise it just shows as infinitely loading 


## Deployed Storybooks
- Deployed Storybooks are showing as errors


## HMR

- Updating a prop in Button or the header in the introduction mdx did not hold reload the page, and hard refreshing also did not display the changes.

## TypeScript 

- `config` argument in main.js refs function currently returns undefined.
- I've added an empty object as a fallback for now.
